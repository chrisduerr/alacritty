What we need:
 - A PTY read buffer to debounce writes while locked
 - No opreations taking forever with the terminal locked


 Process:
  - Read from PTY
  - Try to lock terminal (Should we lock before reading and write straight to it?)
    -> LOCKED:
        - select!(mio, mutex)
        - Mutex free -> Handle staged bytes
    -> UNLOCKED:
        - Handle all read bytes from PTY and go back to mio's polling


TODO:
 - Test channel performance for PTY instead of an array
    -> Maybe can do the PTY -> terminal stuff in different thread
